# Unnecessary Encryptor

A fun web application that applies multiple layers of encryption methods to make your messages unnecessarily complex and secure. Perfect for when you want to annoy your friends by having them go through the process of reversing your encryptions :D

Visit the live application: [Unnecessary Encryptor on GitHub Pages](https://amck7.github.io/UnnecessaryEncryptor/)

## Usage

1. Enter your message in the input text area
2. Select which encryption methods you want to apply
3. Click "🔒 Encrypt" to apply all selected methods in sequence
4. Click "🔓 Decrypt" to reverse the process
5. Use "📋 Copy" to copy the result to your clipboard
6. Click "🔍 Show Steps" to see the step-by-step transformation

## How It Works

The application applies encryption methods in the order they are listed. When decrypting, it reverses the process by applying the methods in reverse order, or probably not working at all, you might get lucky. Each method transforms the text, creating layers of encryption that make the final result completely unreadable.

## Disclaimer

This prolly won't work i was really bored and made it because a friend sent me a stupid message under many different encryptions.

This tool is for entertainment purposes only. Do not use it for securing actually sensitive information!!!!!! Obviously 😛
